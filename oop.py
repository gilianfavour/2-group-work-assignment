# Basic: Create a class called Car with attributes brand and color.
# Instantiate an object of the Car class and print its attributes.

# Intermediate: Add a method called start_engine to the Car class 
# that prints a message saying the engine of the car has started. 
# Create an instance of Car and call the method.
class Car:
    def __init__(self, brand, color):

# Advanced: Create a class called BankAccount 
# with attributes account_number and balance.
# Add methods to:
# Deposit an amount.
# Withdraw an amount (only if sufficient balance exists).
# Print the account balance.

       
class BankAccount:

# Challenge: Implement a class called Library that manages a collection of books. 
# Each book has a title, author, and available status. The Library class should have methods to:
# Add a book to the library.
# Remove a book from the library.
# Check if a book is available by title.
# Borrow a book (mark it as unavailable if itâ€™s available).
# Return a book (mark it as available again if it was borrowed).
